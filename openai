**Task:** Given an SQL query, create a script that extracts information about the query. The script should analyze the query and display the following details:

1. **Columns:** Extract and display the column names involved in the SELECT statement of the query.

2. **Tables:** Extract and display the table names mentioned in the FROM clause of the query.

3. **Filters:** Extract and display any filters specified in the WHERE clause of the query.

**Instructions:**
- Implement a function to extract the required information: columns, tables, and filters.

- Provide a downloadable CSV file containing the extracted information.

**Example:**

Consider the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA';
